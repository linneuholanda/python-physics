    "Differential equations are the bread and butter of physics. The purists would say that theoretical modelling (that is, arriving at the differential equations through physical reasoning) is the physicists' raison d'Ãªtre. Perhaps they were right some decades ago. Today, the bulk of physics (and most of science at that) is application of existing models to ever more complicated systems. This could mean solving non linear partial differential equations in arbitrary geometries. It is clear that the subset of such problems that can be attacked with only pencil and paper is a very narrow one. The world is simply too complicated to be understood analytically. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all is lost though. We are the happy offsprings of the computer era. Many of the problems that shows us no mercy when armed with only pencil and paper offer little resistance to well coded numerical schemes. Our purpose here is to study some of the simplest and most robust of these. And then hopefully we shall also learn a thing or two about physics as well.\n",
