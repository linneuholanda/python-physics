    "The piece of code above uses the [random module](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/random.html). This library contains\n",
    "implementations of pseudo-random number generators for several probability distributions. If you type `random.random()` in the interactive console, you will see that a number in the interval $[0,1)$ is printed to the screen. Thus, `random.random()` samples from the [uniform probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_(continuous) ) in $[0,1)$. In our code above, the number sampled is assigned to the variable `a` and a string is printed to the screen telling us what value `a` points to. What is done next depends on the value assigned to `a`. If the value sampled is less than $1/3$, the boolean expression `a < 1/3` returns `True` and the command `subinterval = \"[0,1/3)\"` is executed. If the sampled number is greater than $1/3$, the interpreter ignores the assignment in the scope of the `if` statement and tests the condition on the `elif` statement. Therefore, if the variable `a` satisfies $\\frac{1}{3}\\leq$ `a` $< \\frac{2}{3}$, the condition evaluated in the `elif` statement will return `True` and the line `subinterval = \"[1/3,2/3)\"` will be executed. On the other hand, if $\\frac{2}{3}\\leq a$, both the `if` and `elif` conditions will be false and the line inside the scope of the `else` statement, `subinterval = \"[2/3,1)\"`, will be executed. After this `if/elif/else` structure, a line telling us the interval `a` belongs to is printed. You should note that you can use as many `elif` statements as you want. Of course, you are not obliged to use neither `elif` nor `else` after an `if` statement: they are optional. The general formula for Python conditional statements is summarized below.\n",

Indeed, they are a nice oportunity to introduce some basic concepts related to object orientation. We can think of particular strings such as `\"hello world\"` as instances of a larger class of objects, in this case the class `str`. The advantage of thinking in these terms is that a class is a big bundle that includes not only the instances, but also functions that act on them. We call these functions methods. For example, given any lower case string, we might want to get its upper case version. This is is easily accomplished with the `str.upper()` method.\n",

    "The next iterable type in Python is the `tuple` type that consists, well, of tuples. They seem very similar to lists, so it is important to emphasize their differences. Just like strings, tuples are immutable. This means that once you have created a `tuple` object, you cannot change it anymore. This adds safety to your code when immutability is desired. Python's designers also had in their minds different uses for lists and [tuples](https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences). Although not mandatory, lists should be homogeneous, whilst tuples should be heterogeneous. This means that each entry in a tuple ideally should have a different meaning. Think for example of polar coordinates $(r,\\theta)$. The first entry of this tuple has a meaning (radial distance) that is different from the second one (angular position).

    "Some quick, important facts about dictionaries. First, the keys can only be of immutable types. Thus, lists cannot be used as keys, for example. Strings, ints/floats and tuples, on the other hand, are perfectly acceptable keys. Second, as should be clear by now, dictionaries are constructed with a pair of braces; an empty pair of braces creates an empty dictionary. Third, we can always add key:value pairs by simply assigning the desired value to the new key. Again, an example should make these matters absolutely clear.   "
